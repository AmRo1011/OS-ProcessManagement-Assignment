# CSE233 – Assignment 2  
## Basic Forks and C-Style Development

This repository contains the implementation of Lab 5 examples (Process Management) and the additional tasks required in Assignment 2 for the CSE233 Operating Systems course.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `screenshots/` — Screenshots of compiling and running the programs.
- `Makefile` — Automates compilation of all examples.
- `LICENSE` — MIT License.
- `answers.txt` — Written explanations for each exercise.

./src/fork_example
./src/linked_program
./src/simple_program
```
